                With a professional background in financial services, I've always been driven by a curiosity to understand the interplay of numbers and technology. This inherent interest led me to delve into the dynamic realm of web development, prompting me to embark on a comprehensive coding course.

            <p>
                This immersive journey equipped me with proficiency in both front-end and back-end development. Throughout the course, I have honed skills in HTML, CSS, Git, JavaScript, APIs, Object-Oriented Programming, SQL, ORM, MVC, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, PWA, React, MERN and State. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Merging my financial acumen with my newfound coding capabilities, I'm eager to explore innovative intersections between finance and technology.
