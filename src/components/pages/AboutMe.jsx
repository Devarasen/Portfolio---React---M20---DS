                Coming from a background in financial services, I've always been intrigued by how numbers intersect with tech. This led me down the rabbit hole of web development, pushing me to dive headfirst into a coding course.

                Now, equipped with coding skills, I'm on a mission to bridge the gap between finance and technology. Building and optimizing, one line of code at a time. I'd love for you to take a look at my portfolio to see the projects that I've been pouring my energy into.
